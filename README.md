Real Time Face Mask Detector - I have created the Deep CNN model and Simple NN model using tensorflow, saved the model weights and config in h5 and json format respectively. 
The model is loaded in OpenCV, which provides real-time face mask detection, as to whether the user is wearing the face mask or not.
