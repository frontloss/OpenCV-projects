# OpenCV-projects
This repository contains all the Open-CV based projects done by me.

Real Time Face Mask Detector - I have created the Deep CNN model and Simple NN model using tensorflow, saved the model weights and config in h5 and json format respectively. 
The model is loaded in OpenCV, which provides real-time face mask detection, as to whether the user is wearing the face mask or not.  

Real Time Facial Expression Detector - Created a CNN model using tensorflow, and loaded the model in openCV to detect seven facial expressions (Angry, Disgust, Sad, Happy, Fear, Surprise, Neutral) on human face using classic Fer Dataset and also my own Face Dataset which I have added in the repository. Face Detection was done using Haar Cascade Frontal Face xml file.
